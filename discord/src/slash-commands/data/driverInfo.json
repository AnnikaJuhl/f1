The young age of the marquess, who was 28 at the time of his death, combined with his status as a sex symbol, caused a shock amongst many. Several tributes and landmarks were named after him, most notably the \"Portago curve\" at Jarama racetrack.\nThe Marquess of Portago was seen by many as a true playboy of his time; \"a tall, handsome and wealthy Spanish aristocrat who captured everybody's imagination\". Gregor Grant famously said of him: \"a man like Portago appears only once in a generation, and it would probably be more accurate to say only once in a lifetime. The fellow does everything fabulously well. Never mind the driving, the steeplechasing, the bobsledding, the athletic side of things, never mind being fluent in 4 languages. (...) He could be the best bridge player in the world if he cared to try, he could certainly be a great soldier, and I suspect he could be a fine writer\".",

On winning the minor British Formula Vee championship in 1971, ever-conscious of the value of public relations, he announced that he was going to be World Champion. This aim eluded him, but he enjoyed a successful career in Formula Three and Formula Two.\nHenton's F1 debut came in 1975 for Lotus, theoretically a good drive but the team was in turmoil with the Lotus 72 finally uncompetitive and its replacement the Lotus 76 a failure, so nothing concrete was achieved. Between 1975 and 1978 he mixed Formula One and Formula Two drives (including a spell in a private March for his own British Formula One Racing Team), never quite establishing himself in either category, but clinched the 1980 F2 championship for Toleman, who took him into F1 for 1981. The first Toleman-Hart was something of a disaster, overweight and underdeveloped, and Henton only managed to qualify once. Unfruitful outings for Arrows and Tyrrell in 1982 led to no more success, though he did set the fastest lap at the British Grand Prix - Henton is the only driver in Formula One history to have set a fastest lap without ever scoring a championship point.\nPerhaps fittingly, his last Formula One outing was at the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in April 1983, which also turned out to be the last non-championship F1 race in the modern era.\nFollowing his retirement from the sport, he returned to running a car dealership and later moved into property development and in recent years has diversified into other areas, notably engineering.

Bristow was called the \"wild man of British club racing\", as he had spun or had collisions on almost every racetrack on which he had raced. He started four Formula One World Championship races and scored no championship points.\nIn his first Grand Prix in a Formula One car, the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix, Bristow recorded a joint-third qualifying time, although he was given the fourth starting spot. He retired on lap 17 due to gearbox issues. Bristow then out-qualified his British Racing Partnership team-mates at the Dutch GP, starting in 7th place, although he was forced to retire again in the opening laps due to an engine issue.\nHe was killed during the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix at the very fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit, in warm, dry, sunny conditions. Bristow wrecked his Yeoman Credit Racing Cooper T51 at the Burnenville corner on lap twenty while fighting to stay in front of the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse. At 22, Bristow was the youngest-ever driver to die in a Formula One World Championship event.\nBristow and Alan Stacey died in close proximity and within a few minutes of one another. They both crashed at Burnenville, the same extended fast right-hand bend at which Stirling Moss had been severely injured the previous day. Cars regularly sped through the Burnenville corner at 120 miles per hour. There was a four-foot embankment there and barbed wire in the meadow about ten feet back from the road. Bristow's Cooper hit the bank and rolled over; he was hurled into the barbed wire, which decapitated him. As the crash occurred on the inside of the corner, his body continued back onto the track, where it sat for the rest of the Grand Prix. His and Stacey's accidents would cause many drivers, including future two-time World Champion Jim Clark, to develop a life-long dislike of the track.\nWith regard to Bristow's unruly driving style, a friend of his said after the accident, \"We all knew this was going to happen. It does no good to say now, but Chris simply did not have the experience to drive that way in Grand Prix racing.\"\nSeveral decades after his death, British Racing Partnership team-boss Ken Gregory called Bristow \"the early Schumacher of his day\", saying \"he [almost certainly] would have been a potential world champion\". However, former team-mate and mentor Stirling Moss called this statement \"extremely over-generous\", saying Bristow was \"probably like a Jean Alesi, if as quick\".\nThe winner of the annual Autosport BRDC Award for promising young British drivers is also presented with the Chris Bristow Trophy.",

  "Ed Elisian": "Edward Gulbeng Eliseian (December 9, 1926 – August 30, 1959), commonly known as Ed Elisian, was an American racecar driver, mainly competing in the National Championship.  He died in a crash at the Milwaukee Mile.\nIn the 1955 Indianapolis 500, he stopped his car in a futile attempt to help Bill Vukovich when Vukovich's car crashed and burned during the race.  He is one of only two drivers in Indy 500 history to stop a non-damaged car to help another driver, the other being Gary Bettenhausen in 1971.  He received a sportsmanship award for his efforts, as well as the wrath of the car owner.\nIn June 1956, Elisian was engaging in a wheel-to-wheel duel with Bob Sweikert, who had won the race in which Vukovich was killed, in a Sprint car race at Salem Speedway when Sweikert made contact with the rail, overleapt it and rolled over outside of the track, suffering fatal skull injuries.  Elisian was exonerated as no collision had taken place.\nIn the 1958 Indianapolis 500, Dick Rathmann and Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row.  Elisian spun in Turn 3 of the first lap, and collected Rathmann, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup.  Pat O'Connor's car hit Reece's car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames.  Although medical officials said that O'Connor was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull, he was incinerated in the accident, in full view of fans and drivers.  Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by the racing community.  Rumors spread that Elisian tried to lead the first lap in order to pay gambling debts owed to a syndicate.\nIn June 1958, Elisian collided with Jim Davis in a Sprint car race at New Bremen Speedway in Auglaize County, Ohio.  After Davis had run over one of the wheels of Elisian's spinning car when trying to pass him at the south turn, both cars flipped over and slid down the track.  Elisian sustained minor injuries, but Davis, who suffered a skull fracture and chest injuries, died at Memorial Hospital in St. Marys, Ohio.  While absolved of blame in the incident, Elisian's unpopularity with drivers deepened.\nIn September 1958, Elisian was suspended for being charged with passing fraudulent checks among other things, but reinstated as of end of May 1959.\nIn August 1959, Elisian entered the USAC Indy car 200-mile (320 km) race at the \"Milwaukee Mile,\" - in West Allis, Wisconsin - known in those days as Wisconsin State Fair Park.  Driving a metallic green Watson-style roadster owned by Ernie Ruiz, he crashed on lap 29 when he spun in oil from A. J. Foyt's engine.  The car hit the wall, rupturing the fuel cell, and rolled over.  Some sixty gallons of fuel caught fire, and took over nine minutes to extinguish.  The crash claimed the life of Elisian.",

He competed in the 1984 FIA European Formula 3 Championship in a Ralt-Alfa Romeo, steadily improving across the season and taking a second place at Knutstorp and a fifth at Jarama to place tenth in the season standings. In 1985 he switched to the Italian Formula 3 Championship, finishing seventh overall and scoring a win. The following year he moved to Formula 3000 with great success, winning races at Birmingham and Enna in 1986 and finishing fourth in that year's championship. He remained in F3000 for the following year, joining the factory Lola team, taking wins at Donington Park and the Le Mans Bugatti Circuit and finishing as runner-up to Stefano Modena in the championship.

His first car was a South African built Dart with a 1500cc Ford engine with a Cosworth camshaft. He achieved a second in class finish in his first three-hour race with this car. He graduated to a Lotus 23 with a Cosworth 1100cc later in 1965 with which he won five national class races in 1966. The car was in an accident later in the year as the rear suspension failed on the Jukskei sweep at Kyalami.\nIn the latter half of 1966, he bought an Elva MK VII and a 1760cc engine from a Porsche RS5 Spider. These two were combined to create an Elva Mk VII-Porsche RS. This proved a formidable combination; his first 2000cc Sports Car Class win came in the car at Bulawayo. Later in a nine-hour endurance race at Kyalami the gearbox failed, but not before setting a fastest lap in his class of 1:34:50 for the old circuit.\nDuring the VIII Grande Premio de Angola, the Elva proved its worth, achieving a fifth overall splitting the pack of Ferrari 250GTs from first to eighth. He achieved a win over the factory Porsches, Ford GT40s and Lolas. Botha later commented that it was his most enjoyable racing experience. He won six Sports Car class races, and two 2000cc 2/3 hour endurance races and only replaced the gearbox once on the car.\nHis move to Formula One came in the form of a Brabham BT11 with a Climax 2000cc engine. On his first outing with the new car he came second (November 1966). He took part in the South African series races the following year until July. He also competed in that year's South African Grand Prix, part of the Formula One World Championship. After 38 laps he had a mechanical problem that was resolved with the help of a spectator and continued to finish the race with 60 laps to his credit. He was not classified at the finish.\nDuring a race at Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in Mozambique, he crashed heavily as a run-off area was swamped by the crowd. The crash claimed the lives of nine spectators and injured 17. After the crash, he did get back into the seat of a racing car, but felt that the spark was no longer there and stopped.\nHe continued his work in civil engineering and assisted with some of the civil engineering work in Soweto. Later he continued his love of South Africa by farming in the KZN-Midlands before moving to East London to fill a post as an engineer. A number of years later he moved his family back to his birth town of Pretoria where he later was appointed as CEO of the Tswane Metropolitan Council.",
